# UHA-CINIC10
CINIC-10 Image Classification Challenge


CINIC-10 is a drop-in replacement for CIFAR-10. 
It is compiled as a bench-marking dataset because CIFAR-10 can be too small/too easy and ImageNet is often too large/difficult. 
CINIC-10 fills this bench-marking gap.
There are almost 2,000 images per class per subset.
